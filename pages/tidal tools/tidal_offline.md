Sometimes in the discovery process, you need to work on servers which are air-gapped or isolated from the public internet. This guide is a central place for installation and usage of all Tidal Migrations offline capable tools.

For these processes, you will also need a server connected to the public internet to build artifacts necessary for the installation and usage of these tools. These guides are written with the assumption that you have a public instance which is connected to your offline instance via SCP, though you could also copy these artifacts over using physical storage media (ie. a USB stick).

## Installation

### Tidal Tools

First, install Docker on both your connected and offline server.

Follow [this guide](https://guides.tidalmg.com/tidal-tools.html) to install Tidal Tools on your internet connected server.

{% include note.html content="Tidal Tools is just a single binary, so if you already have it installed on one machine itâ€™s simple to use SCP to copy the binary onto your offline server! Alternatively, you can use our offline installer by following the steps below." %}

Obtain the offline installer for your operating system from [this page](https://get.tidal.sh/) under 'Offline Installer' and move this to your offline server. 

On your internet-connected server, with Tidal Tools already installed, run `tidal backup`. This creates an archive file with Tidal configuration, and sets up the docker container images for offline use. This will output a single archive (.zip) file. Transfer this file over to your offline server.

Move to the offline server. 

Unzip the Tidal Tools offline installer file, for example on linux: 

`tar xzvf tidal-linux-amd64-*latest-release*.tar.gz`

Next, we need to add the Tidal Tools binary to your system path. 

On linux, move into the unzipped directory you just created and run: 

`mv ./tidal ~/bin/`

Run the following command: 

`tidal restore`

That's it! You're ready to use Tidal Tools offline.

## Usage

### Source Code Analysis

{% include note.html content="This feature is currently in beta." %}

Follow [these instructions](#tidal-tools) to install Tidal Tools on your offline server. 

Run `tidal analyze code --offline your-awesome-project`.

This will save the result to an output zip file, called `code_stats.zip` by default.

Send this file to Tidal Migrations support, and they'll upload it to your Tidal Migrations workspace for you.
